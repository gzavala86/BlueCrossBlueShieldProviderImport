# BlueCrossBlueShieldProviderImport
This python code automates a smoke check for provider form for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Code ends before the form is officially submitted as previous code ran on a test environment 
The Bulk of this code was created by importing python code from Katalon Recorder from January 2020 to May 2020. Code is being finalized starting January 2021.
This was initally created during my time as a Testing Analyst at Blue CrosS Blue shield.
